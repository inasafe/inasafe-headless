        More about this test.
        We are testing that a subsequent run of analysis or multi exposure
        analysis or report generation will properly cleanup QGIS Layer
        registry.
        This is because the same QGIS instance is used on the same thread,
        but different if it is on a different thread. We have to make sure
        each new analysis or report generation is a fresh one.

        Assuming other unittests were checking on each task validity, then
        this method will only test the state of layer registry between each
        task to avoid test duplication.
